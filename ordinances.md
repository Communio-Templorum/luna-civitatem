Streets, Sidewalks, and Other Public Places
--------

* [ ] No all-way stops, ever, anywhere. Use miniroundabouts instead!
* [ ] Detail street/road hierarchy with minimal standards streets must meet based on their
	street-name suffix (so a "Blvd" won't be a little two-land road through nowhere)

Subdivisions
------------

* [ ] How to divide large parcels of land.
* [ ] Require a grid (or very near grid) street layout
* [ ] Prohibit cul-de-sacs (at least for pedestrians)
* [ ] Require multiple connections in and out
* [ ] Require bridge over creeks no further apart than one every half-mile
* [ ] Require straight thru roads in large lots (not that zig-zag nonsense to discourage traffic
	that's not going to be discouraged)

## Trees

## Water, Sewers, and Industrial Waste Discharge Restrictions
