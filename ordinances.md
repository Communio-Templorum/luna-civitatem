Streets, Sidewalks, and Other Public Places
--------

* [ ] No all-way stops, ever, anywhere. Use miniroundabouts instead!
* [ ] Detail street/road hierarchy with minimal standards streets must meet based on their
	street-name suffix (so a "Blvd" won't be a little two-land road through nowhere)

Subdivisions
------------

* [ ] How to divide large parcels of land.
* [ ] Require a grid (or very near grid) street layout
* [ ] Prohibit cul-de-sacs (at least for pedestrians)
* [ ] Require multiple connections in and out
* [ ] Require bridge over creeks no further apart than one every half-mile
* [ ] Require straight thru roads in large lots (not that zig-zag nonsense to discourage traffic
	that's not going to be discouraged)

## Trees

## Water, Sewers, and Industrial Waste Discharge Restrictions

Zoning
------

### General Provisions

* [ ] Buildings, except as otherise allowed below, shall have their footprint fit within a square
	200 feet on each side. A large store or office is not a valid exception; they can build
	up. A factory or warehouse are two valid exceptions.
* [ ] The building's main entrance shall face the street and be clearly visible from the street.
* [ ] Every building's street number must be clearly visible from the street. Secondary entrances
	that face a street must also display the building number. If a building's secondary entrance
	faces different street than that on the building's address, then the street name on the
	building's address must also be displayed and clearly visible alongside the street number.
* [ ] If a building has multiple disjoint sections that each have a direct entrance onto a street
	and is separated from the rest of the building that is publically accessible from the building's
	main entrance, then this section shall be assigned its own address with a separate street number
	along the street it is facing. For example, the main entrance opens to the lobby, but there's a
	restaurant next to the lobby that has a separate entrance from the street, be it the same street
	the lobby faces or not, then it needs its own address.
* [ ] A building shall not be setback from the public sidewalk by more than 20 feet. May allow
	variance for some single-family housing zones. Some commercial zones may allow a larger
	setback for off-street parking, but only to allow no more than two rows of parked cars.

### Residential Districts

### Commercial Districts

* [ ] Commercial buildings must be multi-story, preferably with residential or offices above
	retail. Reserving the second floor for private storage space for ground-floor use shall not
	be permitted. The multiple stories must be for use by people.
* [ ] Stores cannot be more than ~10,000 square feet on the ground floor (or any floor with
	direct access to the streets). A variance may be granted for big box stores and other retail
	that normally operates larger stores, but they cannot break building footprint size
	restrictions (40,000 sqft) or multi-use requirements. Building multi-story stores is
	preferable and encouraged.
* [ ] Malls shall be built under a public Boulevard (or have a Boulevard built over them) and
	provide pedestrian access to both sides thereof. A "mall" being defined as at least
	200,000 sqft of retail space under one roof, whether for one occupant/leaser or divided
	amongst multiple. "Outdoor" shopping malls must be divided between multiple buildings and
	follow the provisions of subdivisions and commercial districts.
