Streets, Sidewalks, and Other Public Places
--------

* [ ] No all-way stops, ever, anywhere. Use miniroundabouts instead!
* [ ] Detail street/road hierarchy with minimal standards streets must meet based on their
	street-name suffix (so a "Blvd" won't be a little two-land road through nowhere)
	* __Alley__: A narrow, one-lane street. ([Example](https://streetmix.net/-/897979)). Not a street
		proper, but an accessway behind buildings for loading and/or parking access. If in a residential
		neighborhood, then plantings are encouraged.
	* __Avenue__: A two-lane street, or four-lane street with a median, lined with tall trees that will
		create a canopy over the street. ([S Cedar St, Charlotte, NC](https://streetmix.net/-/897988))
	* __Boulevard__: A multiple-lane road with a center carriageway or two for through traffic and side
		carriageways for parking, local traffic, and bicycles. Each carriageway to be separated by a
		planting strip with trees. Each side of the road must have a wide sidewalk with tree along the
		local carriageway. All thoroughfares in this city must conform to this standard and will be
		designated transit corridors.
		([All main thoroughfares in Chinese cities](https://streetmix.net/-/898003))
	* __Drive__: A narrow street through a single-family residential neighborhood. This is a local
		street, probably no lane lines, and allows parking on at least one side of the street. Must
		include 8-foot tree planting strip and 6-foot or wider sidewalks. Intended for local traffic
		only. ([Example](https://streetmix.net/-/898010))
* [ ] All roadways with a median must include pedestrians refuges at all crossings.

Subdivisions
------------

* [ ] How to divide large parcels of land.
* [ ] Require a grid (or very near grid) street layout.
* [ ] Prohibit cul-de-sacs (at least for pedestrians).
* [ ] Require multiple connections in and out.
* [ ] Require bridges over creeks no more than a half-mile apart.
* [ ] Require straight through roads in large lots (not that zig-zag nonsense that fails at
	discouraging traffic).
* [ ] Require residential neighborhoods include park land with a playground.
* [ ] Require greenways on both sides of all creeks. This is done in Korea for flood control,
	but is also a great amenity.

## Taxation

## Traffic and Vehicles

Trees
-----

* [ ] Require preservation of trees along creeks and in parks
* [ ] Require preservation and planting of trees on residential properties
* [ ] Require preservation and planting of trees in plazas

## Utilities

------

### General Provisions

* [ ] Buildings, except as otherise allowed below, shall have their footprint fit within a square
	200 feet on each side. A large store or office is not a valid exception; they can build up. A
	factory or warehouse are possibly the only two valid exceptions.
* [ ] The building's main entrance shall face the street and be clearly visible from the street.
* [ ] Every building's street number must be clearly visible from the street. Secondary entrances
	that face a street must also display the building number.
* [ ] If a building's secondary entrance faces a different street than that on the building's address,
	then the street name of the building's address must also be displayed and clearly visible
	alongside the street number. This is also required for main entrances that face the corner of an
	intersection.
* [ ] If a building has multiple disjoint sections that each have a direct entrance onto a street
	and is separated from the rest of the building's publically accessible areas main entrance, then
	this section shall be assigned its own address with a separate street number along the street it
	is facing. For example, the main entrance opens to the lobby, but there's a restaurant next to
	the lobby that has a separate entrance from the street, be it the same street as the lobby or not,
	then it needs its own address.
* [ ] A building shall not be setback from the public sidewalk by more than 20 feet. May allow
	variance for some single-family housing zones, but cannot exceed 100 feet. Some commercial zones
	may allow a larger setback for off-street parking, but only to allow no more than two rows of
	parked cars.

### Residential Districts

* [ ] Gated communities provide only a _false_ sense of security while blocking off access and
	discouraging walking. Thus, gated communities are _strongly_ discouraged. Gated communities
	cannot be exempt from the subdivision, building size, and offset limitations outlined elsewhere.

### Commercial Districts

* [ ] Commercial buildings must be multi-story, preferably with residential or offices above
	retail. Reserving the second floor for private storage space for ground-floor use shall not be
	permitted. The first two stories must be open for access and active use.
* [ ] The building footprint may be increased to a square 300 feet on each side if all walls facing the
	streets will be active with at least two separate leasees/stores/offices having their entrances
	no more than 150 feet apart.
* [ ] Stores cannot be more than 10,000 square feet on the ground floor (or any floor with direct
	access to the streets). A variance may be granted for big box stores and other retail that
	normally operates larger stores, but they cannot break building footprint size restrictions
	(square 300 feet on each side) or multi-story requirements. To reiterate: building multi-story is
	required.
* [ ] Malls shall be built under a public Boulevard Thoroughfare (or have a Boulevard Thoroughfare
	built over them) and provide pedestrian access to both sides thereof. A "mall" being defined as
	at least 200,000 sqft of retail space under one roof, whether for one occupant/leasee or divided
	amongst multiple. "Outdoor" shopping malls must be divided between multiple buildings and
	follow the provisions of subdivisions and commercial districts.

* [ ] Stores on the ground floor must keep their windows open, always displaying something or
	allowing visibility into the store.
	* This is targeting vape shops that cover their windows to stop any prying eyes&hellip; They
		can go on the second floor if they do not wish to comply.
* [ ] Gyms are not allowed on the first floor, except a narrow entrance as desired, but no
	more than about 30 feet wide facing the street.
* [ ] The city's Thoroughfares must be lined with commercial property. Prefer retail on the
	ground floor, but not required. All commercial property must have their main entrances face
	the thoroughfare, not a private street or backyard parking lot.
* [ ] An example of storefront requirements from
	[Midtown Atlanta](https://www.midtownatl.com/_files/docs/retail-storefront-design-manual.pdf)
	may provide inspiration for retailers.
* [ ] Along Thoroughfares, permanent buildings signs will be allowed on the ground floor and the
	floor above it. The total number of signs on these two floors shall not be constrained
	(provided they do not obstruct entrances, fire exits, and the street number signs), but a
	constraint on the size of individual signs may be imposed. This is so retail, restaurants, and
	other businesses inside a building may be noticeable by pedestrians and drivers to encourage
	them to come into the building. Temporary signage, such as for advertisements, may be
	more strictly restricted.
* [ ] Buildings with multiple stores, restaurants, or other retail open to the public must
	feature signs on the exterior by the main entrance showing all such stores accessible through
	the main entrance and the floor number of each for easy pedestrian reference. See also the
	street signs in China and Japan for detailed examples.
* [ ] All elevators must include the business directory within the elevator, normally on the
	back wall. This is standard in China, Korea, and Japan and reminds people which floor they are
	looking for.

### Industrial Districts

* [ ] The only buildings that can have a large footprint are factories and warehouses that
	require so much space on one floor. These buildings are encouraged to build offices above
	for themselves or to offer for rent.
* [ ] Shall be downwind from the city center.
* [ ] Light industry may be built along the Thoroughfares if they conform to the building
	footprint restrictions and do not create a noise disturbance. Such light industry may be
	allowed a greater setback than neighboring buildings provided that they include a decorative
	see-through brick or stone fence where the normal setback would be for a building, and shall
	stretch across the whole of the front of the property, but the building's setback from the
	fence cannot exceed 100 feet.

### Institutional Districts

* [ ] Schools are encouraged to be placed so their school zones do not reach any
	Thoroughfare.
* [ ] Active adult retirement communities shall be located within one-eighth of a mile of a
	Thoroughfare.
* [ ] Child care centers are discouraged from locating on a Thoroughfare.
* [ ] Nursing homes, rest homes, homes for the aged, and elderly or disabled housing shall be
	located within one-quarter of a mile of a Thoroughfare.
* [ ] All other institional uses are encouraged to build along a Thoroughfare.

### Offstreet Parking and Loading

* [ ] Parking decks cannot have car access directly from any Thoroughfare. Alleys are the
	prefered method of access over local streets.
* [ ] All commercial property within a quarter mile of a Thoroughfare shall have _no_ required
	parking minimum. The Thoroughfares are meant as walkable transportation corridors.
* [ ] Once public transit is established in the city, no new off-street parking in the Central
	Business District (CBD) will be allowed within office buildings. This district of no
	off-street parking may also be extended to other areas of concentrated office space served by
	public transit.
* [ ] Large retail stores and offices that require off-street parking are required to join a
	parking collective that provides and maintains public off-street parking for its members.
* [ ] Place two pairs of one-way streets, one north-south, one east-west, each street having 2 or
	3 lanes, underground through the CBD. Egress and ingress into underground off-street parking
	can only be from these streets. Above these streets will be linear parks for pedestrian access
	to the buildings.

#### Restriction on use of off-street parking and loading spaces.
The storage of merchandise or materials, or the repair of motor vehicles or any kind of equipment
except for the temporary storage of construction material and equipment while work is taking
place on the structure where the off-street parking is located, is prohibited in all off-street
parking and loading spaces, including required and unrequired spaces.

### Accessory Uses and Structures

* [ ] Accessory dwelling units (ADUs) shall be permitted as an accessory to any single-family
	detached dwelling unit. The ADU may be exempt from the requirements of the main entrance and
	being visible from the street, but must keep its main entrance as close to the street as
	possible (though a little room may be given for architectural reasons, like having a window on
	each side of the door). The ADU's address must be the same as that of the main dwelling unit
	but with "½" appended to its street number.
* [ ] Drive-throughs are terrible! Okay, they can be allowed in alleys with the whole waiting line
	hidden behind the building.
	* As with parking access, drive-throughs cannot break up the streetscape too much. Multiple
		properties in the same block requiring drive-throughs should use the same alley with only one
		point of ingress and one point of egress.
	* Drive-throughs cannot be allowed within the Central Business District (CBD) and other areas
		with limited car use.
	* Should probably also not allow drive-throughs in properties abutting single-family housing.
